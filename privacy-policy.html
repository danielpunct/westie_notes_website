            <section>
                <h2>1. Scope</h2>
                <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Westie Notes mobile application available on iOS and Android. By using the app, you agree to the practices described here.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>2. Overview</h2>
                <p><strong>Westie Notes</strong> is a note-taking app designed to help you organize your thoughts, tasks, and ideas. We take your privacy seriously. In short: <em>your notes are encrypted before being stored</em>, and we use <em>Firebase Authentication</em>, <em>Firebase Storage</em>, and <em>RevenueCat</em> for subscription management. Your sensitive data remains protected and encrypted.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Data Collection and Use</h2>
                <p>We collect and process only the minimum information necessary to provide and improve Westie Notes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> We use Firebase Authentication to let you sign in securely. This may involve storing your email address or other identifiers needed for login.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encrypted Notes Storage:</strong> Your notes are encrypted locally before being uploaded to Firebase Storage. Firebase never has access to your unencrypted data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> We use RevenueCat to handle in-app purchases and subscriptions. RevenueCat processes purchase-related information, such as transaction receipts, subscription status, and associated identifiers from Apple App Store or Google Play, to enable premium features. We do not store or have access to your payment card information.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Advertising:</strong> Westie Notes does not include any third-party advertising SDKs and does not show ads or use ad networks for targeted advertising.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Westie Notes uses privacy-friendly analytics tools to understand app performance and usage patterns (for example, which features are used most). These analytics are used only to improve the app.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>4. Local and Cloud Storage</h2>
                <p>Your notes are encrypted and stored in Firebase Storage for backup and synchronization. A local copy may remain on your device for offline use. If you uninstall the app, local data will be deleted, while encrypted backups will remain tied to your account until you delete them manually or request removal.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>5. Device Permissions</h2>
                <p>Westie Notes requests only the permissions necessary for its core features (for example, notifications). You can manage permissions in your device settings. Westie Notes does not access your contacts, photos, or location unless explicitly required by a feature you enable.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>We rely on trusted third-party services to operate Westie Notes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Firebase (Google LLC):</strong> Used for authentication and encrypted cloud storage. For more information, please see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used for subscription management and in-app purchase validation. For more information, please see <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>7. Billing and Payments</h2>
                <p>All purchases and subscriptions are processed securely through Apple App Store or Google Play. We do not collect or store your payment details. RevenueCat acts as an intermediary to verify purchases and manage subscription status using data provided by Apple or Google. You can manage or cancel subscriptions directly through your device’s account settings.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
                <p>Westie Notes is suitable for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can address it.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
                <p>You can request deletion of your account and associated cloud data at any time. Depending on your jurisdiction (for example, under GDPR/CCPA), you may have rights to access, delete, or export your account-related data (such as email and purchase history). To exercise these rights, please contact us using the email below.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>10. Security</h2>
                <p>All notes are encrypted before storage. Authentication and billing are handled via trusted third-party providers (Firebase and RevenueCat). We recommend protecting your device with a passcode and keeping your software up to date.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this policy to reflect app improvements or new legal requirements. If a material change occurs, we will update the date above and may provide an in-app notice.</p>
            </section>
